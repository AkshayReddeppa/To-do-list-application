Key Features:

Task Creation: Users can add new tasks with descriptions and optional due dates.
Task Viewing: The application displays all existing tasks, including their descriptions, due dates, and completion status.

Task Deletion: Users can delete tasks that are no longer needed.
Task Prioritization: The application may allow users to prioritize tasks based on importance or urgency.
Task Search: Users can search for specific tasks based on keywords or due dates.
Code Structure:

Task Data Structure: A data structure (e.g., a list or dictionary) is used to store task information, including the description, due date, completion status, and priority.
User Interface: The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) or a command-line interface (CLI) for users to interact with the to-do list.
Task Management Functions: Functions are implemented to handle the creation, viewing, completion, deletion, prioritization, and search of tasks.
Persistence: The application may save the to-do list data to a file or database for future use.
